I have a dataset that consists of few thousands observations in and Excel .csv file. 
The Excel csv file has columns headings in the first row. 
Each subsequent row represents a single observations and it has an observation date in the column named 'date'. 
The subsequent columns are named 'd1', 'd2','d3','d4','d5','d6','bonus' and contain categorical values. 
There are 50 categories represented by numbers from 0 till 49. 
A single row may not have repeating categories.
Create python code to input the data file, prepare it for processing, 
then create a transformer model to train on the created sequences, 
and then predict next observation values in columns d1 - bonus. 
Let me know if you need additional instructions or information.
